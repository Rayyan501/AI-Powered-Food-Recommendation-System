# AI-Powered-Food-Recommendation-System
## 🔍 Overview

Modern diets are often unbalanced due to lack of nutritional awareness and meal planning tools. This system leverages machine learning to help users make healthier choices by:

- Predicting the caloric content of foods using a **Random Forest Regressor**
- Recommending similar foods based on user preferences using **K-Means Clustering** and **Cosine Similarity**

The system is built on a reliable dataset from the **USDA (via Kaggle)** containing over 5,000 food items with 20+ nutritional attributes.

## 🚀 Future Work / Full-Stack Integration

This system can be extended into a full-stack application with:

- A **frontend interface** (e.g., Streamlit, React, Vue.js) for user inputs and recommendations  
- A **backend API** (e.g., FastAPI, Flask) to serve model predictions  
- Real-time user interaction for:
  - Custom food preference entry  
  - Instant calorie estimation  
  - Personalized food suggestions
